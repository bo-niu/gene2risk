### Structure of the *ui* directory

```
|- ui: ui server, serves all the front end pages.
    |- browser: browser side specific files.
    |- public: the public dir that ui server serves.
    |- scss: Sneha's scss dir. Recommended to move to src dir.
    |- src: all the React component source codes.
    |- server: server side specific files.
|- api: api server. Used for server google account login, file upload and future database.

```

### Where does your create-react-app codes go?

#### Previous directory structure:

```
|- sneha: 
    |- public: Everything goes to ui/public
        |- index.html: goes to ui/server/template.js
    |- scss: Everything goes to ui/scss
    |- src: Everything goes to ui/scss except the following:
        |- App.js: goes to ui/src/routes.js
        |- index.js: split into browser side render and server side render corresponding to ui/browser/App.js and ui/server/render.js

```

### How to run the app locally?

1. remove the old node_modules and package-lock.json from ui and api directory and `npm install` in both directories. (It is better to remove first because I updated the dependencies a lot.)
2. rename the `sample.env` to `.env` in both ui and api directory.
3. Open three terminal windows:
   1. First window: `cd api`, `npm start`. This will start the api server.
   2. Second window: `cd ui`, `npm run watch-server-hmr`. This will apply hot module replacement functionality so that after modifying codes, we do not need to restart server.
   3. Third window: `cd ui`, `npm start`. This will start the ui server.
   4. Do not close the three windows while developing.
4. Now the website should be there in `localhost:8000`

### Note
1. I have configured the `webpack.config.js` so that you can develop the front end React codes pretty much the same as in your previous create-react-app directory structure. If anything goes wrong please message me in Slack.
2. The reason why we have two server is to balance the load so that ui server works only for providing the website and api server works in proxy mode.
3. I added two components (plotly and Dropzone) in the Home page just for testing. You can remove them if needed.
4. Everytime the codes change and the browser get automatically updated, one more file in `ui/dist` will be generated. Therefore, remember to remove all files in `ui/dist` from time to time. (create-react-app can automatically do this for you? But in this framework we have to do it manually.)
5. To run the app in production mode, open two terminal windows:
   1. First window: `cd api`, `npm start`.
   2. Second window: `cd ui`, `npm run compile`, then wait for 20 seconds, `npm start`.
